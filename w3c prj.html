    <h1>A Little History of the World Wide Web</h1>

    <p>from 1945 to 1995</p>
    <h2>1945</h2>
    <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="">an article</a> in <a href="">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device 
       called a Memex, for memory extension,
       which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
    <h2>1980s</h2>
    <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href=""> Bootstrap Institute</a> library.</p>
    <p>Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing,
     and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York,<a href=""> Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but 
     the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.</p>
    <p>Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program,
       "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, 
        and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III.

    <dd>Mike Sendall, Tim's boss, Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system.</dd>
    <dt>october</dt>
    <dd>Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment.
         He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See <a href="">the first browser</a> screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for 
         the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine). <br>
         Project <a href="">original proposal</a> reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert 
         <a href="">cailliu</a> (ECP) joins and is co-author of <a href="">new version</a></dd>
